title: About
---

I'm Guilherme a.k.a colobas.

I usually say my life goal is to save the World. It might be too ambitious, so
I'd already be happy if I could just make it a better place, ideally through 
meaningful research and work. I'm hardworking and resilient. I play for the 
team. I don't give up. When I'm not coding, hacking a project together, 
training a machine learning model, reading a book, cooking, running, travelling,
playing some instrument, or spending time with my friends and family, I'm
either sleeping or trying to.

I'm currently on leave from [jungle.ai](http://jungle.ai), to finish my MSc
thesis.
