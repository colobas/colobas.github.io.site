This is a Braindump I did while listening to Philosophize This' episodes
on the Frankfurt School


- "programmed" from birth to think of ourselves as worker-consumers
- alienating job
- consumption to fill the void of human interaction
- there is an exploited class and an exploiting class
- money is intrinsically connected to political power. fake political freedom
(if you can only choose from options that serve the generally the same group of
interests, you're not really free to choose)

### REBUTTALS

- increase in quality of life (only made possible by exploiting 3rd world
countries)
- what if the only way to experience the benefits of an advanced technological
social system is that the average person has to be a "cog-wheel"
