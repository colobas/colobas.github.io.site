I like sharing the notes I take when I'm going through papers, articles, or
general topics. However I don't always take notes on the computer, and in
fact I enjoy physically writing more than I do typing and writing LaTeX. So
this time I decided to scan the notes I took while going through [this awesome
write-up on how UMAP works](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_umap_works.html).

Please bear in mind I'm wasn't rigorous at all with this, as the goal was more to
gain intuition than to give a formal account of this. Please do read the link
I pointed to above, it's a really good read.

Also, I hope my handwriting is understandable.
